He is an Indian Hindu. He has a post-graduate degree in computing. Physically, Shravan is in pretty good shape. He is average-height with pale skin, black hair and black eyes. He has buck teeth. He grew up in a middle class neighbourhood. He was raised by his mother, his father having left when he was young. He is currently single. His most recent romance was with a chef called Whitney Alicia Mclaughlin, who was 11 years older than him. They broke up because Whitney felt Shravan was too materialistic."
